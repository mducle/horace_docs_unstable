% calculate number of bins to read enough pixels to fill pixels
% buffer and recalculate the number of pixes to read from every
% contributing file.
% Inputs:
% npix_per_bins -- 2D array containing the section of numbers of
%                  pixels per bin per file
% npix_in_bins  -- cumulative sum of pixels in bins of all files
% npix_processed-- first bin to analyze from the npix_section
%                  and npix_in_bins
% pix_buf_size -- the size of pixels buffer intended for
%                 writing
% Outputs:
% npix_2_read  --  2D array, containing the number of pixels
%                  in bins to read per file.
% npix_processed --total number of pixels to process during
%                  folowing read operation. Usually equal to
%                  pix_buf_size if there are enough pixels
%                  left.
% npix_per_bins  -- reduced 2D array containing the section of
%                   numbers of pixels per bin per file left to
%                   process in following IO operations.
% npix_in_bins  --  reduced cumulative sum of pixels in bins
%                   of all files left to process in following
%                   IO operations.
% last_fit_bin  -- the last bin number to process for  the pixels
%                  to fit pix buffer
